    I currently work at Aesir Media Group, and its companion companies HIDIVE/Sentai Filmworks.
    I am working full stack, which basically means I am a part of every part of the software lifecycle. 
    Participating in planning meetings, creating technical documentation, to writing/testing the code,
    and finally deploying and monitoring the software. In this role I have made many improvements, some
    of the more substantial improvements have been increasing the speed of the site by creating an in house
    logging system using AWS Lambda, improving user bounce rate to our site by implementing a new email verification
    system, and integrating a more secure system by moving our user base to AWS Cognito.

    Attending Baylor has made a huge impact on me as an individual. I was able to learn from some of the
    brightest professors and peers which pushed me to expand, and challenge myself as an individual.
    As a student in the Computer Science programming I was able to learn many different facets of the Computer Science and
    Software Engineering world. I took classes on Data Mining, Computer Architecture, and Operating Systems that grew my knowledge and
    allowed me to learn new programming languages like C, C++, Java, and SQL. I also took courses more primarily focused on Software like
    Software Project Management where I learned about the different software lifecycles and the pros/cons between them, which is what sparked
    my inspiration to become a Software Project Manager in the future.
    I also learned a great deal from leading and participating in volunteer opportunities and in being a captain for my club's sports teams.
    All in all Baylor gave me memories, experiences, and influences that have grown my love for learning, and given me a passion for my work.
