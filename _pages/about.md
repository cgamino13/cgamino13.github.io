Hello! 

If you don't already know and somehow stumbled upon this site on the vast web, I am Carlos Gamino, pleasure to meet you!

I was born, raised and currently living in **Houston, Texas**. This city holds a special place in my heart, other than being
the city of my childhood and where all my family resides, it has a melting pot of cultures, food, and things to do so I am never bored.

For four years I was able to attend and graduate from **Baylor University (Sic 'em Bears!) with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science**.
While attending Baylor I was able to learn leadership, confidence, integrity, and humility. Volunteering in campus wide events
like Steppin' Out where we give back to the community by doing service projects, and leading preparation for a national convention, Goodphil,
are just a few of the ways attending Baylor has strengthed my abilities.

Professionaly, I have held many positions that grew my knowledge in many domains, with many personalities in a way that I feel comfortable
working with a wide array of teams under varying conditions. Currently, I work with **Aesir Media Group as a Software Engineer**, and I have my hands
on the whole project life cycle, from planning the feature, working on back end and front end implementations, to deploying and monitoring the system
to production using DevOps tools. I enjoy finding more efficient and clean ways to implement features while incorporating known and standard design patterns.

When I am not working I enjoy a wide range of hobbies:
* Playing pretty much any sport (Although currently I am in a big volleyball phase)
* Traveling (My most recent ventures have been to Hawaii and Toronto)
* Destressing through video games (My all time favorites are the Kingdom Hearts and LoZ series)

There's much more I could include but that's pretty much me in a synopsis!

Thanks for reading and learning a little about me, now I'd love to hear and [get to know more about you!](/contact)
