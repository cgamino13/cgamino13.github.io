105 more days left.

Spent a good amount of time wireframing today. I wanted to get my thoughts on paper for how I want the site to 
ultimately feel like. Right now in my head I currently have about 9 pages. I need to make includes which are kinda like
models or pieces of the site. Once I am complete with those pieces I can add all of the pages of the site together.

Once I have all the pages of the site together then I will have to fill those contents out with actual information.
Then when I have my information in I will need to keep the styling uniform, actually I might do this before inserting
my information, that might be a better idea.

Will not make any huge headway with this tomorrow or Saturday, going to be busy but I will still be posting my thoughts
for the day.
