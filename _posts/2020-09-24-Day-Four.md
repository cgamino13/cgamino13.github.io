104 more days left.

Well it has been a few days but I finally am able to push out version 1.0 of my site. It was a lot more work than I anticapated orginally.

I did not think that using jekyll would have so many different options to do things, I was stuck in CSS HTML hell for hours trying to get things just right.

Now time to let it sit and soak for a while. Def will not be able to look after it, I am going to start a deep dive into Comp Sci fundamentals now,
so join me in solving some leetcode problems.

Although I do have more ideas in mine and some refactors I need to do. I want to add images to these blogs, I also want to make changing from like to dark mode
persistent, but that is for another day.

Your friend,
Los
