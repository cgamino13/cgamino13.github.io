106 more days left.

I was able to do a few things today, unfortunately I was struggling trying to have other pages of my site processed from 
markdown to html, so it just looked ugly. I was finally able to get it figured out by removing an annoying variable
for content being set in the header. Apparently, when you set the content to a variable Jekyll does not run that md
file through the process to turn it into valid html. Weird huh?

I will not be pushing to master tonight, will try to push tomorrow.

*Here are a few things that I completed today*
1. Created and set up Google Analytics
2. Created and set up comments with Disqus
3. Update gitignore
4. Add functionality for people to directly download my resume

*I realized that maybe one days worth of time after work may be pushing it to try to have all of the things I want to
complete be down, so this next list will be what I want to complete by Sunday (9/20)*
1. Add some more about me info on the left hand side of my column with links to other pages
3. Remove any unneeded includes or other topics that I want to replace
4. Create a better theme that I can customize
5. Create an about me page
6. Contact page
7. Work, Fun, Education
8. Have a button to change from light to dark mode
9. Modify index/home page to look cleaner
