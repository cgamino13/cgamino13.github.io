Today is the start of my journey to 2021. 107 more days left.

In those 107 days I plan to:
* Get this site up and running, looking all prettyfull
* Write a blog post a day
* Be a master of Data Structures and Algorithms

Follow me as I ravenge my way through Jekyll and pages of documentation, DS/Algos, and LeetCode questions.

Signing off for the first time.

**JUST KIDDING...**

So for now I have done a few things:
1. Updated my profile pic to one that is actually a picture of me
2. Added a GitHub svg (I don't even know what a svg is...actually I do now) which is the wrong color
3. Wrote my first blog ;)

*There are a few things I want to have done by tomorrow night:*
1. Add functionality for people to directly download my resume
2. Add some more about me info on the left hand side of my column
3. Remove any unneeded html files, don't really have much on github right now so I do not want to show that first
4. Maybe use a different theme?
5. Add a git ignore file to my project

Now that I have all my thoughts written out..for real this time...

Signing off for the first time.
